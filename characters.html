                <strong>Light Yagami</strong> (Japanese: 夜神 月 ライト, Hepburn: Yagami Raito) is the main protagonist of the
                manga series Death Note, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. He is portrayed as a brilliant but
                bored genius who finds the Death Note, an otherworldly supernatural notebook that allows the user to
                kill anyone by knowing their name and face, after it is dropped by the Shinigami Ryuk.

                <strong>L Lawliet </strong>(Japanese: エル・ローライト, Hepburn: Eru Rōraito), known mononymously as L, created
                by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. He is an enigmatic, mysterious, and highly-esteemed international
                consulting detective whose true identity and background is kept a secret. He communicates with law
                enforcement agencies only through his equally inexplicable handler/assistant, Watari, who serves as his
                official liaison with the authorities.

                (Light Yagami) as she supports his cause to "cleanse the world of evil". Using her own Death Note, a
                notebook that allows its owner to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face that she received
                from the Shinigami Rem, Misa does everything she can to aid Light. This includes shortening her own
                lifespan by half, twice, in order to receive the eyes of a Shinigami, giving her the ability to learn a
                person's name just by looking at their face.

                Death Note, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. He is a Shinigami that drops a Death Note, a
                notebook that allows the user to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face, into the human world
                to find relief from the boredom of his own realm. It is picked up by Light Yagami, a bright high school
                student who uses it in an attempt to create and rule a utopia cleansed of evil, with him at the helm as
                a "god".

                <strong>Rem</strong> (Japanese: レム, Remu), is the Shinigami who gives Misa Amane one of the Death Notes
                she had. Like Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; however, Rem did not get hers through trickery. The
                Shinigami Gelus, who had fallen in love with Misa, sacrificed himself to kill her destined murderer. In
                doing so he was reduced to dust, leaving only his Death Note. Rem delivered this Death Note to Misa,
                since it was her life he saved.
